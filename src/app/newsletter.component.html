                    conduction, but they were worried about the labs
                    conducting online. Lab Co-Ordinators made clear
                    to parents that, they are taking videos personally
                    in lab and showing to students live video and
                    uploading it in the GCR. They are also told to use
                    the laptop when showing the lab steps so that
                    they can execute the experiments along with the
                    faculty as well.
